# 2. Describe the Train object.
# The class must contain fields and a method for adding wagons
# (it is necessary to add objects, instances of the wagon class).
# Describe the class Wagon together with the train.
# The Wagon must contain a list of passengers and allow adding passengers.
# In the Wagon can be 10 passengers for example.
# When using the len function on a Wagon, I want to see the number of passengers.
# When using len on a train, I want to see a list of Wagons without a locomotive.
# Each wagon must have a number.
# When printing a wagon to the console, I want to see the following "[n]" where n is the number of the wagon.
# ***
#
# Implement a train print from task 2.
# When you print a train, wagons and a locomotive should be displayed in the console in the following format:
#
# ï»¿<=[HEAD]-[1]-[2]-[3]-[4]-[...]-[n]-[n-1]
